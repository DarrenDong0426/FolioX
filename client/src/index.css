 * The order should be: base, components, then utilities.

 * - The components layer builds on base styles with reusable component classes.
 * - The utilities layer contains low-level classes that can override styles in the other two layers.

 * Base Layer of Tailwind
 *
 * - Normalizes styling across different browsers (via Preflight).
 * - Adds sensible defaults to elements like headers, paragraphs, and buttons.
 * - Sets default font sizes and box-sizing (which affects how element dimensions are calculated).
 *
 * => Ensures consistent styling across browsers.

 /* 
  * Components Layer of Tailwind
  *
  * - Defines reusable component styles.
  * - Includes Tailwind’s built-in components and your custom ones using "@layer components { ... }".
  *
  * => Makes UI patterns reusable and keeps class names meaningful.
  */

 /* 
  * Utilities Layer of Tailwind
  *
  * - Includes Tailwind’s utility-first classes like p-4, text-center, bg-blue-500, etc.
  * - These classes apply single-purpose styles.
  *
  * => Enables fast, inline styling without writing custom CSS.
